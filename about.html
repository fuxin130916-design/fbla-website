    <p>The Olympic Flight museum is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preserveration and flying of vintage aircraft. The museum was founded with the goal of bringing people together to relive, recollect and learn about aviation history. Our Mission is to deliver the sights, sounds, smells and excitement of flight to every museum visitor.

We strive to bring the excitement of vintage aircraft and the history of aviation to community members and visitors alike. The museum features both flying and static aircraft, hosts the annual Olympic Air Show and offers community events with the goal of sharing the historical significance of aviation both in the military and civilian sectors.</p>
